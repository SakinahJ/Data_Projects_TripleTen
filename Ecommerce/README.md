# Ride-Sharing Data Analysis for Zuber

This project focuses on analyzing ride-sharing data to uncover patterns in passenger preferences and the impact of external factors, such as weather, on ride frequency. As an analyst for Zuber, a new ride-sharing company in Chicago, I studied the companyâ€™s database and competitor data using SQL to identify trends, optimize services, and understand market dynamics.
