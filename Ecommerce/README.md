#### Description:
-8 page spreadsheet
-Includes raw data (Hidden), processed data, data analysis, and pivot tables.

#### Process:
I began by exploring, filtering, and cleaning the data to ensure accuracy and consistency. Next, I developed a conversion funnel and prepared the data for cohort analysis. I then calculated retention rates and finalized the formatting and documentation to enhance readability for the client.

#### Data
- `''raw_user_activity'`: Each row represents an activity, or event, by a user on the companyâ€™s website
- `''user_id'`: unique customer IDs
- `''event_type'`: the type of activity by the user
- `''category_code'`: category of the product being viewed or purchased
- `''brand'`: the company that makes the product
- `''price'`: price of the product, in USD
- `''event_date'`: date of the user activity, in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `''Table of Contents'`: Preformated yet empty table of contents sheet
- `''Executive Summary'`: Preformated yet empty executive summary sheet

#### Assumptions:
- The "raw_user_activity" sheet accurately captures all website activity within the specified timeframe.
-Missing values and inconsistencies are minimal and do not impact analysis.
-The data format, including column structure and data types, is correct and consistent.


#### Findings:
Results: Conversion Funnel	

Synopsis: From customers that have viewed the website, 29% of them have added an item or items to their shopping cart.  Out of those who added items to the shopping cart, there is a 36% conversion rate to the actual purchase from the cart.  

Results: Retention Rates	

Synopsis: Purchases decrease over time. However, customers who made thier first purchase in September had higher retention that other months following.  It would be beneficial to try various targeted campaigns to these customers to increase the retention and sales rates. 

#### Recommendations/Results:
#### Boost Conversion Rates

Send abandoned cart emails or push notifications to recover lost sales.
Offer limited-time discounts and simplify the checkout process.
Improve product pages with better visuals, descriptions, and reviews.

#### Increase Retention
Analyze why September customers had higher retention and target them with loyalty offers.
Use personalized emails, rewards programs, and post-purchase engagement to encourage repeat sales.
Test different marketing strategies to optimize retention efforts.
