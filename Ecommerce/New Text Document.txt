
Step 1 Exploratory Data Analysis:

Analyze the number of taxi rides by company for specific dates in November 2017, sorting by trip volume.
Focus on companies with "Yellow" or "Blue" in their names for early November and evaluate ride counts for top companies like Flash Cab and Taxi Affiliation Services.
Group smaller companies into "Other" and sort by trip volume.

Step 2 Ride Duration Analysis:

Compare ride durations from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport on rainy Saturdays versus other days and conditions.
Identify "Bad" or "Good" weather hours based on conditions (e.g., rain or storms) and link weather data to ride durations.
Filter for Saturday rides and exclude incomplete weather data.
