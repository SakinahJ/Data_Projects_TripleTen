# The Effects of Music on Mental Health – Data Analysis
This collaborative analysis explores the impact of music on mental health, examining how different genres, listening habits, and emotional responses influence well-being. Using data-driven insights, we analyzed trends and correlations between music consumption and mental health indicators.

Key Focus Areas:
The relationship between music genres and mood improvement.
How listening frequency affects stress, anxiety, and overall mental well-being.
The role of music as a coping mechanism for mental health challenges.
This project was conducted in partnership, leveraging data visualization and statistical analysis to uncover meaningful patterns in the connection between music and mental health.

#### Data
DESCRIPTION HERE:
- `'mxmh_survey_results_raw'`: All data from a survey done based on music listened to and the reported mental health of the individuals
    

#### Assumptions:
- Music influences mood, stress, and well-being.
- Different genres affect emotions differently.
- Frequent music listeners may experience better emotional regulation.
- Data accurately represents diverse individuals' music preferences and mental health.
- Self-reported mental health data is reliable.
- External factors impact mental health but are not the focus here.
- Active listening has a stronger impact than background music.
- Responses are subjective, leading to variability in results.


#### Findings:
-This study demonstrates the multifaceted role of music in mental health. While Rock, Pop, and Metal are widely favored and frequently listened to, they can also exacerbate negative moods during prolonged exposure. This paradox underscores the need for mindful listening and personalized music interventions.

#### Recommendations/Results:
1. Mindful Listening – Encourage reflection on music’s emotional effects to align with mental health goals.
2. Personalized Music Therapy – Use favorite genres for therapy, balanced with calming music to regulate emotions.
3. Awareness Campaigns – Educate on the risks of intense music genres and promote healthier listening habits.
4. Further Research – Explore the cultural, psychological, and physiological factors influencing music’s mental health impact.
5. Balanced Music Diet – Advocate for a mix of fast and slow genres to support various emotional.
