# The Effects of Music on Mental Health – Data Analysis
This collaborative analysis explores the impact of music on mental health, examining how different genres, listening habits, and emotional responses influence well-being. Using data-driven insights, we analyzed trends and correlations between music consumption and mental health indicators.

Key Focus Areas:
The relationship between music genres and mood improvement.
How listening frequency affects stress, anxiety, and overall mental well-being.
The role of music as a coping mechanism for mental health challenges.
This project was conducted in partnership, leveraging data visualization and statistical analysis to uncover meaningful patterns in the connection between music and mental health.
