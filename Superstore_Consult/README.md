#### Description:
- 8-page Tableau Visualization
- Includes data analysis, charts, and dashboard.

#### Process:
Joined Sheets â€“ Merged relevant data tables for analysis.
Identified Profit & Loss Centers â€“ Determined key areas driving profitability and losses.
Evaluated Advertising Impact â€“ Assessed the value of advertising during company triage.


#### Data
DESCRIPTION HERE: One Excel spreadsheet file provided by TripleTen
- `'orders'`: details all fields for each ordered item
- `'returns'`: details all fields for each returned item


#### Assumptions:
- Profits from sales are totaling in the negative.
- There is one or more causes for negative profits directly related to orders and returns.
- The operations department will need to make changes.
- The advertising department needs recommendations.


#### Findings:
Subcategories profit centers are Copiers, Phones, and Accessories while loss centers are Tables, Bookcases, and Supplies based on profits.

Profit Centers are Office Supplies and Technology in the West Region while loss centers are Office Supplies and Furniture in the Central Region based on profits.

Several products are causing negative profits, some as high as $20k in losses.

Advertising campaigns should be targeted towards Indiana in October, Missouri in November, and Vermont in November.

Returns are a serious problem with many products having high return rates, as high as 100%.

There are several customers with high return rates, as high as 100%.

When considering average profits vs return rate, there are a few individual products that are not worth selling and many products left to consider continuing or not.

#### Recommendations/Results:
- Optimize Profitable Areas â€“ Focus sales and marketing efforts on high-performing products and regions to sustain profitability. Invest in marketing and product development to maximize success.
 
- Address Loss-Making Products â€“ Conduct a detailed analysis to determine the causes of losses. Adjust pricing, improve operations, or discontinue consistently unprofitable products.
  
- Strategic Advertising â€“ Allocate 1/5 of a stateâ€™s monthly profits to advertising during peak seasons. Tailor campaigns to regional preferences and market trends for maximum ROI.

- Reduce Return Impact â€“ Investigate high return rates, as they significantly impact profitability. Analyze customer behavior, address repeat return issues, and implement loyalty programs to improve retention.
