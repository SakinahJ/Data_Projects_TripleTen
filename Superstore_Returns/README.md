# File Title: Superstore Returns 

This independent project, part of the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program, showcases my skills in Tableau dashboards and data storytelling.
I conducted an analysis for the CEO of Superstore to identify key factors driving order returns and provide actionable insights to reduce return volume.
