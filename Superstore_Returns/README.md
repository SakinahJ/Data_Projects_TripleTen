# File Title: Superstore Returns 

Product returns negatively impact revenue, operations, and customer satisfaction. This analysis in Tableau identifies key issues driving high return rates and provides data-driven solutions.

Focus Areas:
- Identifying return patterns.
- Exploring causes (e.g., product quality, shipping, customer expectations).
- Recommending strategies to reduce returns.

#### Description:
- 6 Tableau Visualizations, 1 Dashboard, and a 10-page Story Presentation
- Includes data analysis, charts, dashboard, and Tableau story

#### Process:
-Data Preparation â€“ Joined and cleaned relevant datasets.
-Exploratory Analysis â€“ Used visualizations to identify key factors contributing to returns.
-Dashboard Development â€“ Built an interactive Tableau dashboard for monitoring returns.
-Storytelling & Presentation â€“ Created a Tableau story to effectively communicate findings and insights.

#### Data
DESCRIPTION HERE:
- `'Superstore.xls'`: each row corresponds to one product sold; sheets were LEFT JOIN'd
    - `'orders'`: details all fields for each ordered item
    -  - `'returns'`:  details all fields for each returned item
 

#### Assumptions:
- High return rates are negatively affecting revenue and operational efficiency.
- Returns are influenced by factors such as product quality, shipping issues, or mismatched customer expectations.
- Addressing the root causes of returns will improve profitability and customer satisfaction.


#### Findings:
- More states in the West coast have a higher return rate.
- Binders and paper have the highest return rate.
- We have some customers that have a 100% return rate.
- August and December have the highest return rates.
- Customers who choose same day shipping have a higher chance of returning their items.

#### Recommendations/Results:
1.  Assess our high-return products for defects and proper item description.
2. Assess the shipping quality of our items to ensure items are arriving in good shape. This is concerning the high return states. 
3. Focus on marketing campaigns to increase sales on low return products. 
4.  Evaluate our return policy, especially on specific products and seasonal changes.
