You've been hired to help a client analyze the Manhattan vacation rental market. They want guidance on which property types to invest in, and your task is to analyze Airbnb data for insights.
You’ll make your recommendations by answering these questions:
* Which neighborhoods and property sizes (i.e. number of bedrooms) are most attractive for vacation rentals?
* How much money did these listings generate?


Which neighborhoods and property sizes i.e. number of bedrooms are most attractive for vacation rentals?
To answer this question, you’ll need to analyze the following information using pivot tables:
* The neighborhoods which are most attractive for vacation rentals
* The property sizes (i.e., how many bedrooms) that are most popular for vacation rentals
* If different neighborhoods have different preferences for property sizes
But how can we assess a listing's attractiveness? An example of one way is by looking at how many days each property has been rented. Reviews are a good estimate of how often an Airbnb property is rented since they only appear after a stay, and let's assume they reflect rental frequency.
